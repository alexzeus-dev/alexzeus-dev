Hi, I’m @alexzeus-dev.

I have a strong interest in gym and fitness, blending my passion for health with tech development. Currently, I'm advancing my skills in Python, Adobe After Effects, Blender, and CorelDRAW to expand my creative and technical capabilities.

You can reach me on Instagram at @alexprosign.

Fun fact: I'm literally David Laid.
